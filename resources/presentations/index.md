The following presentation is a work in progress. I'm using it to take notes as I discover
new approaches that can help my development skills.

The presentation uses [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/). During the presentation you can use the 'S' key to access the speaker view, where speaker notes are present, along with a timer and a preview of the next slide. You can also press the 'B' key to pause the presentation (darken the screen).
