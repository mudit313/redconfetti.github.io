I've worked on various projects that used various task management applications hosted in the cloud (software as a service). I hear about new ones every so often, so I decided to note them here for future reference.

<a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com/" target="_blank">Pivotal Tracker</a> - Anyone trying to adopt the agile / scrum method of development has likely used this.

<a href="http://basecamp.com/" target="_blank">BaseCampHQ.com</a> - This is the first Rails application. The reason Ruby on Rails exists. Simple and elegant.

<a href="http://www.wrike.com/" target="_blank">Wrike.com</a> - Very flexible. Can be used to multiple people, in different organizations, matching any special hierarchy of tasks.
