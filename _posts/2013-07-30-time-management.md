<p>I've recently became aware of a time management technique known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" target="_blank">Pomodoro Technique</a>. You time a period of work for 25 minutes, then take a short break, then do another period again. This helps you gauge the amount of work you're getting done in a period of time, and is supposed to help with mental agility.</p>
<p>My friend uses <a href="http://www.publicspace.net/Vitamin-R/" target="_blank">Vitamin R</a> as an app on his Mac to remind him of how much time he has left during a time period.</p>
