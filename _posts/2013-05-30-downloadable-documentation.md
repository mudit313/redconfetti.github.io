<p>Some people want to download the documentation for the languages they're using. This is needed when an internet connection isn't available (like using a laptop on a plane), or even for the sake of speed.</p>
<p>Here are two sources of downloadable documentation.</p>
<p><a href="http://railsapi.com/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails Documentation</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Ruby documentation</a></p>
