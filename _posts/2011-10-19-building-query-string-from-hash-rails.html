<p>I have a model has a method that generates and stores a cached link to it's own view for use in mailers. Under Rails 2 the method which generated this link created the beginning of the URL based on the owner of the object (this is a multi-domain system I'm working on), however it required that a hash of parameters be included in the link.</p>
<p>Under Rails 2 the 'options' hash would be passed to build_query_string inside of my method like so:</p>
<pre class="brush:rails">params = ActionController::Routing::Route.new.build_query_string(options)</pre>
<p>Under Rails 3 I receive this error:</p>
<pre class="brush:shell">wrong number of arguments (0 for 7)</pre>
<p>It turns out that under Rails 3 the Hash library includes a to_query method.</p>
<pre class="brush:rails">
irb(main):001:0> h = {:blah => '1', :blah2 => '2'}
=> {:blah=>"1", :blah2=>"2"}
irb(main):002:0> h.to_query
=> "blah2=2&blah=1"
</pre>
