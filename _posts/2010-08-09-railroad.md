I just discovered that there is a Ruby gem which generates diagrams based on Rails models (ActiveRecord). I ran across this website a while back, but didn't quite connect the dots. I was just reading [an article](http://plasti.cx/2007/07/29/rails-models-in-a-namespace) on placing models into their own namespace, and I realized that the diagram it uses as an example was generated using RailRoad.
