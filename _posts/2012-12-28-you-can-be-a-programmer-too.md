<p>I've been telling people to check out <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/" target="_blank">CodeSchool.com</a> because it has well laid out interactive courses that you can take to learn advanced web development technologies (jQuery, Coffeescript, Rails, etc).</p>
<p>However, it doesn't have the prerequisite courses on HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Ruby.</p>
<p>It turns out that <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">CodeAcademy.com</a> covers those languages.</p>
<p>Of course not just anyone can be a web developer, but if you're nerdy and this stuff excites you, then go for it. I have a job working in San Francisco as a professional developer, doing Ruby on Rails programming. No college. Just experience. Just takes will and determination, and the effort to get experience even if it means taking a pay cut for a while.</p>
<p>If you're looking for something a little more low level, like algorithms or an intro to computer science, check out <a href="http://www.udacity.com/" target="_blank">Udacity</a>.</p>
