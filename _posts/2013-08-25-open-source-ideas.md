I've become aware of how important it is to provide a portfolio of things to share with prospective employers. Having a [Github](https://www.github.com/) profile that shows off all the Gists and public repositories you've contributed to serves as a perfect portfolio piece.

Most of the work I've done has been on private systems however, and I've discarded the code, because I don't own it and don't want legal trouble. So what can I do that is practical, helpful, and/or fun!?

Here is my list of pet project ideas that I plan on doing in the future.

* Pop Culture Faker - There is a tool that outputs fake names, business names, phone numbers, addresses, etc. called [Faker](http://rubygems.org/gems/faker). Often I find myself using names like '[Bob Barker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Barker)', or '[Joffrey Baratheon](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Joffrey_Baratheon)' in my tests. It would be cool to make an alternative version of Faker (or [FFaker](https://github.com/EmmanuelOga/ffaker)) that pulls from common names of celebrities, fictional characters, etc.
* Gemfile Annotator - I remember hearing about a gem that would [annotate your Rails models](https://github.com/ctran/annotate_models). I want to make one that adds the name, description, and Github project URL for each gem inside of your Gemfile, like so:

``` ruby
# Figaro
# Simple Rails app configuration
# https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro
gem "figaro"
```
