<p>I've become aware of how important it is to provide a portfolio of things to share with prospective employers. Having a <a href="https://www.github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> profile that shows off all the Gists and public repositories you've contributed to serves as a perfect portfolio piece.</p>
<p>Most of the work I've done has been on private systems however, and I've discarded the code, because I don't own it and don't want legal trouble. So what can I do that is practical, helpful, and/or fun!?</p>
<p>Here is my list of pet project ideas that I plan on doing in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pop Culture Faker - There is a tool that outputs fake names, business names, phone numbers, addresses, etc. called <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/faker" target="_blank">Faker</a>. Often I find myself using names like '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Barker" target="_blank">Bob Barker</a>', or '<a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Joffrey_Baratheon" target="_blank">Joffrey Baratheon</a>' in my tests. It would be cool to make an alternative version of Faker (or <a href="https://github.com/EmmanuelOga/ffaker" target="_blank">FFaker</a>) that pulls from common names of celebrities, fictional characters, etc.</li>
<li>Gemfile Annotator - I remember hearing about a gem that would <a href="https://github.com/ctran/annotate_models" target="_blank">annotate your Rails models.</a> I want to make one that adds the name, description, and Github project URL for each gem inside of your Gemfile, like so:
<pre class="brush:ruby"># Figaro<br />
# Simple Rails app configuration<br />
# https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro<br />
gem "figaro"</pre><br />
</li></p>
<li>What else might I think of ?!?!</li><br />
</ul></p>
